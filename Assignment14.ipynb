The RGBA model is an extension of the RGB model, which represents colors using combinations of red, green, and blue color channels. The additional \"A\" in RGBA represents the alpha channel, which indicates the level of transparency or opacity of the color.\n",

The combination of these channels determines the final color appearance. The alpha channel specifically determines the transparency of the color, with 0 representing fully transparent and 255 (or 1.0) representing fully opaque.\n",
